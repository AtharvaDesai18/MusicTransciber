Music Transcriber AI
This is a web application that uses the Klangio API to transcribe audio files (WAV or MP3) into sheet music. The application features a Node.js backend to securely handle API requests and a modern, responsive front-end with a neon theme and a video background.

Features
AI-Powered Transcription: Converts audio recordings of instruments like piano, guitar, and vocals into downloadable sheet music.

Instrument Selection: Choose the primary instrument in the audio file for more accurate transcription.

Multiple Output Formats: Download transcriptions as PDF, MIDI, or MusicXML files.

Secure API Handling: A Node.js server acts as a proxy to protect your secret API key.

Stylish UI: A dark, neon-pink theme with an animated, gradient border and a video background.
